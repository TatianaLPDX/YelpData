# Predicting Consumer Appetites: can Yelp determine a model for success? 

## Project Objective:
The main objective of this project is to build a data model that allows its users to predict business future success (success is defined by 1. if this business has any reviews in 6, 9, and 12 months) and if the number of reviews is increasing). The model will utilize specific criteria (such as rating score, number of ratings, and geo-location of business) and combinations of these criteria in order to create the most accurate predictions.

## Project Summary: 
In today’s world success of every business is decided on people’s reaction. 
Data Analytics helps businesses identify potential opportunities to streamline operations or maximize their profits. It helps identify potential problems, eliminating the process of waiting for them to occur and then take action on the same. Hence we decided to choose a topic that would help businesses decide on what factors should be considered and how people’s reaction can boost or kill their business.  

We plan to use the Yelp Dataset and provide a predictable model that would help us in deciding the success of a restaurant or any other business that is on Yelp.
The Yelp dataset contains various data pointers such as star ratings, text review, user-check in, tips by users and details about the users who review such as the number of comments, location, active since etc. Using these features provided by Yelp, we plan to build predictable models to find the success of business based on various factors such as user reviews, star ratings, geo locations etc.In order to do this we plan to use the below mentioned data visualisation and analytics tools.

 - Data visualisation tool: Tableau
 - Data analytics: Python/Pandas
